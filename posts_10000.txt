tbh i was expecting nintendo to do the splatoon route and call genders "styles" and have romance interest be a personality compatibility thing. but instead they just outright put genders and romantic gender preferences. idk thats just refreshing to see right now.
not only that, but nonbinary is an explicit option. thats cool as hell. blah blah woke game nah man this just rules no irony.
I think there value in doing it intermittently so you learn what you’re capable of IF you enjoy your work enough. Otherwise you’re going to crash out.
As someone who was working in this space at the time, it was striking how there wasn't really a strategy for using outriders at all. In fact if you tried to do outriding people often got annoyed because it was against the 'small target' strategy.

We should be very worried. There's a top-2 primary, the top 2 vote-getters proceed regardless of party. The Republicans in the race are consistently polling 1-2. That's because there are 9 Democrats in the race.
Simplified model: Say it's a 65-35 split between Ds and Rs. The two Rs get 18 & 17. The 9 Dems split the other 65, and it's tightly bunched. None of them are getting to 17. Democrats could outpoll Republicans by 30 points and still get shut out of the general election.

You do provide helpful context, and thank you for your excellent reporting on this story! Sorry I jumped on you but there is almost no climate benefit from gas v coal and yet the public still thinks there is because we keep mentioning the point of combustion CO2-only numbers...
...A better way to frame gas power would be that "gas systems that leak over 4.7% of their methane (when considering a 20 year timeframe)...have life-cycle emissions intensities on par with coal," and newer satellite based monitoring is finding leak rates exceed that at many U.S. wellheads.
The entire story we were sold about the U.S. reducing emissions from the coal to gas shift ignores methane leaks because we simply were not sufficiently monitoring them in the 2000s-2010s. Thanks for the qualifiers in your excellent piece, but they could have gone further.

Leaseholder service charges are spiralling out of control. Residents have contacted me after being hit with shocking bills: ➡ 70% increase in one year (from £1,800 to £3,200) ➡ £5,000 to empty a dog bin ➡ £1,000 for CCTV that doesn’t exist ➡ Charges for a gym that hasn’t been built
I will continue to campaign for residents against these often unjustified, unexplained, and unaffordable charges. In the last year I've organised public meetings for residents in Vickers Green, Park East and East Side Quarter and I will continue to speak out about these spiralling costs.
I spoke in Parliament during the Property Service Charge debate, putting on record my residents experience, and I called for greater protections and regulation. Find out more about my campaign for leaseholders here www.danielfrancis.uk/leaseholders.

My PC, a Minotaur Druid named Gordo, remembers most of his childhood & early adulthood when he was enslaved by Humans in Theros and forcibly taken from his home and family to Faerun. He wished he didn't remember the feeling of his father's blood on his face, when he was shot helping Gordo to escape.
I assume they centered impacted communities in making this decision (or hope they did anyway), but it seems like a pretty big tradeoff to me.

I think there's a lot of unhealed behaviour and holdover from before nerd-dom became mainstream.   It feels like being bullied for things people liked in their youth, only to find that suddenly all the "cool people" are also liking them unpersecuted must be jarring.
So I can imagine that the gatekeeping is an attempt to preserve an identity both for themselves and for their hobby? I think it's more reflexive than anything.   But you talk about D&D and I think about some old-school players who're very tied to the racist cores of it.
I dunno how often you've seen the people adamantly defending the biological essentialism of like..."ORCS AND DROW ARE EVIL ALWAYS", mixed with "This is what I think Elf Breast Milk tastes like" ,etc etc. It's a bit yucky, so I can also imagine it feels like people are coming in to yuck their yums.
So, at least from the D&D world, I can point out a few things:  I see players who get very tied to their characters; there's a lot of bleed. It's a power fantasy after all, and so people instinctively tie their self-worth into the narrative. A failed roll feels like a personal failing sometimes.
So I suspect some people, to some level, feel a sense of invasion into their power fantasy. Suddenly it's no longer special. I can imagine it must feel like a violation of sanctity, like watching a restaurant tweak your favourite dish to cater to a wider audience and not just you.
So like I said, unhealed behaviour for certain.   I could probably talk about this for hours. Someone put me on a podcast or something iuno.

at practice they're their usual selves, but in private? that's when iwazumi softens. before they even admit their feelings for each other, iwazumi does what oikawa asks of him without question. "im so sore" is all oikawa has to say for iwazumi to let out a gruff and start massaging oikawas shoulders
affectionately scolding him to stretch better. he tells iwazumi to sit down and he does so without a second though, oikawa tells him to give him the yummier bun and iwazumi makes a fuss but really, he will always give in. oikawa will eat pushovers alive, and being easy isn't iwazumis
style so he puts up a fight, a hassle. but it doesn't go unnoticed. oikawa softens with every private interaction, rewarding iwazumi with purrs and teasing shoulder bumps; with brief hair tousles and cheek pats. and when they finally confess, when their efforts for affection gets reciprocated–
iwazumi wears a tie or anything similar around his neck for oikawa to tug on. oikawa might be the one receiving, but iwazumi is the one whining when oikawa makes him wait to cum. it's iwazumi thrusting hard and fast when oikawa tells him "fuck me". and oikawa relishes every moment of
iwazumi who's so big, reliable and strong on the court, at practice, in life..  to wait for oikawa's command for action, whimpering for his omega to let him knot; needing his alpha urges to be met by the sweet scented omega he's known his whole life. and oikawa loves it all so greedily
Sheesh. Sorry Scott you’re still an asshole
Why certain people change there pronouns depending which better benefits them in that instance or scenario. I’m all for be who you want to be. It’s just when I see one moment one pronoun announced, the next moment a new one, then like 10 minutes later back to the original one confuses me.
A broken taillight 11 days prior to being murdered on by an ICE thug does not meet the "imminent threat" threshold required to authorize a shooting.  Fox is using the footage to characterize Pretti as a "violent agitator."  This is the age-old "smear" campaign designed to distract from the facts.

He's cruel b/c he's a) primitive AND b) dumbass.
The bloodshed is only coming from one place Mr Homan.  I know the constitution is currently in shreds, but there is still a first amendment.  Stop killing innocent people.  Stop terrorising communities.  Stop racial profiling people.  Stop behaving like the Gestapo.  Hope this helps.

I also want ICE abolished.  But republicans wouldn't vote for abolishing it.  How do you want them to do this right now?  While it would be a good show of solidarity for them to go to Minneapolis - that also wouldn't stop this bullchit.  It would only exacerbate it.    So what's the right answer?
Absolutely! I came to social media for several reasons and, one of them was to meet people from all over the world. The main reason, though, was to fight fascism.

read the substack on how school, not social media, is bad for kids/teens. have no opinion on the merits of that particular claim. but I think it's interesting that, if we did conclusively prove that going to school for 6-8 hours a day was actively very bad for children, it wouldn't matter.
because, well, "what else are we supposed to do with them?"

Obama tried to eliminate advantage plans and improve Medicare, but Republicans didn't allow him to go that far.  But if you're unlucky enough to need major surgery, an advantage plan limits your out-of-pocket amount.  I had a $110,000 bill but co-paid $170, thanks to IBM's advantage plan.
Its not just one loser mob its like every 5 months we have a mob vote with the losers mobs and we can even get them with new interactions.

I can get behind that. And it’s a brilliant plan actually. I think one reason Musk was booted out was because he was getting all the attention. So you may be on to something 👍
Trump may be stupid or have dementia, but Miller, Vance, Musk ... are young, radical and rational. They are the bigger danger.

“The Korean community must stop assuming 'we're safe' and instead stand in solidarity with other Asian communities. Adoptees must be seen as part of our community." v.daum.net/v/2026012905...
“…approximately half of the entire Korean-American population in Minnesota is estimated to be adoptees, and expressed concern that many of these individuals are isolated from immigrant communities and related information networks because they are often adopted by white families.”
Note that many adoptees and adoptive parents believe adjacency to whiteness will shield one from harm. It will not.   Also note that many adoptees have “white” sounding names. Even if you’ve got your passport, chances are they’re gonna say you don’t “look” like your name.
The fact that this article was posted on a Korean site matters. Have not seen any articles about MN Korean adoptees and how the surge may affect them or why they need to be mindful of what is happening.  Closest thing has been Mark Rosen speaking out about it from an adoptive parent POV.

Getting a role where the fact that my brain fires in 15 different directions is a benefit feels nice so far.
This is America. No one cares until it's a white man, or white woman, or white child. Its why every white murderer gets news reel about being disturbed while anyone non-white is a tattooed gang-member. The same media bias that promoted fear hasn't changed.
Obsessed, I want you to be mine
Oh yes this does feel very "we need to show <family member> how much you like the gift I don't care you were fighting two seconds ago" child energy
Well said, though I wish this wasn’t such an accurate summary.  I realize this is an insignificant, point in the unrolling fascism before us, but the fact that we’re living under the most fragile, subpar, incurious, and stupid cowards is soul-deep irritating and crushingly annoying to me.
If you ever happen to find yourself as the self appointed caretaker of a recently regressed dragon, then their vast hoard of wealth is always a valuable tool to make sure they're working those yucky big kid thoughts out of their little noggins like they're supposed to! ⤵️
At first, the new hatchy may object to you spending all their hard earned wealth on diapers and other baby supplies alongside demands to turn them back to normal, forcing you to constantly remind them of how much they need their diapers in their regressed state and how many they go through a day!
When those daily protests and tantrums die down and the ex-mighty master of the lair begins to ask for certain brands of diapers or what you invest in a wipe warmer, that's when you can tell their formerly keen thought pattern is starting to irreversibly gear back towards infancy!
It shouldn't take long after that until your hatchy is drooling around their favourite paci you bought them, rationalising all their many daily accidents away as out of their control, and lisping how they "wuv" their diapees and you even as you drain more of their once precious hoard!
How they always giggle so sweetly as you tell them how many packs of their favourite diapers you got them in exchange for one of their prized golden coins, their only knowledge of the value of their hoard being how many diapers and toys they can get for it!
After that, it doesn't take much more for even that rudimentary grasp on the worth of their hoard to fade, a few more loaded diapers leaving your hatchling with no more of their old self and the only reaction to their hoard being their infantile instincts telling them that shiny is pretty and good!
This is a critical moment for my family in Gaz@. Winter, displacement, and war have pushed us to the edge. I am urgently asking for help to protect my child and restore a basic life. Your action today can change everything.

No. They knew that. I knew that too. But they represented a whole of something that has been a blockage for months now.  The end result? They heard my pain, they understand the situation and stress in full. And movement is being made. In the right direction. Now I feel like I need a nap.

That's an entirely different question. I'm childless and think I have worth, nonetheless. That doesn't mean I don't support children.

Yes, it was all a LIE by Trump & his fascist nazis. ALL that comes out of Trump's mouth is a LIE, except when an uncontrollable impulse due to excitement of harming & screwing over people, a bit of truth may slip out. He's a pathological liar. Fucking over people comes easy to him, as he ENJOYS IT.

Good question. I think it's maybe like a frontend "hype" which has a little bite desapear with time, because making a "cool website" is maybe more trivial nowadays with all the ecosystem. Maybe less jobs too.  Besides, people no longer ask "How to" on Slack; we ask easily to the LLM.

I don’t think people realize how inconvenient they’ve made it in SC to vote. Drop boxes made it easy to turn in your ballot. The election folks had made arrangements for more boxes — libraries, city halls, etc, not less. Now there is often only one place to turn in your ballot (the election office)
Unless it’s during early vote.  You can turn in only 5 ballots per election showing your picture ID and giving them your name and address. Onerous.

1. Multicare / Mary Bridge Children's Hospital in Washington State has become the latest hospital to shut down its trans youth care clinic in capitulation to Trump.  Private clinics say they are stepping up to take patients.  Subscribe to support our journalism.
2. The MultiCare Mary Bridge Children’s Hospital in Tacoma, Washington, notified patients on Monday that it would be closing its pediatric gender health clinic due to political and legal attacks on trans-affirming care. It will begin winding down operations immediately.
3. Patients who are 18 and older will be redirected to their primary care physician for hormone replacement therapy, while minors already on puberty blockers or HRT will have to consult their health care team for options—seemingly outside the MultiCare system.
4. The stoppage is “due to recent escalations at the federal level to eliminate medical interventions to treat gender dysphoria for minors nationwide, as well as investigations and significant penalizations of health care organizations that provide such care,” the spokesperson confirmed.
5. Numerous health care institutions are indeed being probed by federal authorities, and the ensuing litigation can indeed be costly. However, the Trump regime has yet to make good on its threat of withdrawing Medicaid and Medicare funding from a hospital for providing gender-affirming care.
6. At the same time, the majority of MultiCare patients rely on Medicaid and Medicare. This includes more than 300 primary, urgent, pediatric, and specialty care locations across Washington, Idaho, and Oregon, as well as 13 hospitals.
7. “Based on my interactions with the medical staff at Mary Bridge, they’re heartbroken,” Sierra told Erin in the Morning. “They don’t support what the leadership is doing, although all of us, including me, understand they need federal funding in order to stay open.”
8. “Trans children are the sacrificial lamb here,” she said. “In order to keep the show going, that’s what’s happening.”
9. The White House is continuing to target safe havens for trans youth—but the presence of institutions (or lack thereof) who are ready and willing to fight for the trans community has been consequential.

Perhaps.  But Tobacco Control's go-to tactics for 50 years have been STIGMA and COERCION.  Not ethical.  Malaria control seeks to control disease and vector (mosquitoes).  Tobacco Control seeks to control PEOPLE.  Stigma is reprehensible.  Rejected for illicit drugs.  Embraced by tobacco control.

“ICE has wasted no time spending its war chest, buying new tools ranging from biometric trackers to mobile phone location databases, spyware and drones, while loosening restrictions on how it uses some of these technologies.”
“These new surveillance powers come at a time when ICE is also pushing the bounds of its traditional role of immigration enforcement. In recent months, ICE leaders, backed by top Trump administration officials, have asserted the authority…”
“…to use all available tools to monitor and investigate anti-ICE protester networks, including U.S. citizens. Democratic lawmakers and civil rights groups say the agency’s expanding use of its surveillance tools infringes on privacy and free speech rights of immigrants and U.S. citizens alike.”

Hey Tom, whose town, OUR TOWN, not yours.
One interesting thing you may not know about publishing is that at this point there are only 4 people alive who still purchase a book, open it, and read the words inside. All the stores and campaigns are to reach them. Famous authors like Stephen King sometimes reach as many as 2 with a single book.

The White House released this AI fake image of #Trump.  Let’s face it, if Trump looked like this rather than the grotesque out-of-shape pig he really is, Melania would be by his side at every opportunity … and she would appear with him for free! 🇺🇸

I had a dream that we allowed them to "separate" by leaving the country—im sure they'll be welcomed by their American supporters right?—and the land was returned to the First Nations. With assistance from the Canadian Gov to aid with the transition, it could be a true step towards reconciliation.
One more question for my tech followers. I'm also looking for an RGB modded NES as well. It's one of the main consoles I play on, so a clear picture is much needed there.  If you have any leads on just outright buying an RGB modded console (preferably with the expansion audio chip!)

Men will always play this game, knowing that rape and sexual assault are often very difficult to prove. They can twist this difficulty into something like "there's no evidence" and get away with it, which is exactly what men like Gaiman teach other men. What a legacy.
It doesn't matter how many women describe abuse at the hands of one man, men like this just will not listen.  "How dare women interfere with a comic book I built my identity around." Fuckery.

That is the conclusion one would have to come to since you keep accusing those who believe in ONE god as starting with killings. But ok. I am glad you came to the conclusion that humans were killing each other long before that.

I think also maybe money and status mean less now than they once did?  I left a job that paid me north of $70K in Dec to be unemployed because the job sent me to the hospital twice, and put me out on disability for a year.   I’ll never make that much again. But I’ll probably live longer.

HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has appointed 21 new members to the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC), many of whom have a history of criticizing vaccines.  www.medpagetoday.com/pediatrics/a...
David S. Mandell, ScD, dept. of psychiatry at University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine  "bulk of the recently appointed members appear to be people who adhere to untested, disproven, and sometimes dangerous ideas about what causes autism and the best ways to care for autistic people."
"The group appears stacked to give Secretary Kennedy political cover to continue his assault on life-saving vaccines and to promote unproven treatments."
"My hope is that, as IACCs have done in the past, they'll focus on the need to increase funding and expand care within the many public systems that serve the overwhelming majority of autistic people, including special education, Medicaid-funded services, and vocational and rehabilitation services."

Going in knowing anything about the way the game operates basically destroys its appeal, so I don't think it's your fault. It basically boils down into a decidedly un-special experience (music aside) if you remove that X-factor.  For me, it has done things no other game has come close to doing.

Killing or raping children, which is more brutal? Of course, Trump isn't Hitler exactly. But in many ways, they bear a striking resemblance. Lack of empathy, a lust for power at any cost, killing as a political tool, narcissism, and a perceived divinity.
I still have a hard time believing EVERY swing state went to Drump. That seem like an impossibility without shady actions. Time will “Hopefully” tell.

F.B.I. agents executed a search warrant on Wednesday for an election center in Fulton County, Ga., seeking to seize ballots in a significant escalation of the administration’s efforts to investigate a jurisdiction that President Trump has continued to criticize over his 2020 defeat in the state.
The move harnesses the investigative power of the Justice Department and the F.B.I. behind baseless claims by Mr. Trump and his supporters that the 2020 election was stolen from him.

They think the entire government should be shut down until ICE is abolished, because they don't care how many people hurt for something that isn't going to happen.
Well, you might be able to partially blame DC for that one. While shoveling snow is still required, our Nation's capital has suspended fines for not doing so within the first 8 hours of daylight. It's blaming the ice for pausing the penalty.

Ok. One thing I hadn't understood about the playoffs is that there's a draw for who you play - it isn't just highest vs lowest in each bracket. Which - means we could play Sporting - but also seems dumb? What's the point of eight games to determine seeding if you don't entirely use it.

You're certainly correct. The problem with sweeping changes is that usually to have to break some things and some people are going to end up worse off, or at least feel that way. Voters don't like this. See Dems getting destroyed in 2010 over the ACA. Or inflation too high under Biden.

At first, ICE didn’t want to talk.   This may be the only video of a real conversation with an ICE agent.   After following them from an elementary school where they’d been circling to a parking lot, I was able to get a few words in. This is part of that conversation.
As you’ll see, in a genuine conversation, even this ICE agent understands that they must be accountable.   And when I’m elected to congress, we will hold ICE accountable- every agent who abused their authority, pepper sprayed kids, or illegally broke into someone’s home.
But until November, we have to use our voice in whatever ways we can.
Protest. Make noise.   Talk to your friends and neighbors.   Support your community.  And if you get the chance at a safe distance- even talk to an ICE agent– and make it clear that if they want things to change, they must be part of that change.   This is how we get ICE out of Minnesota.

If it pisses you off they’re using our own tax dollars to fund a secret police to murder us, imagine how people of color feel. I was angry at the state of things before, including in other countries, now I’m just flat out enraged.
We MUST have justice and reparations to move forward from this. The way our own tax dollars are used MUST be reformed so that the actual people have a primary say, not just the folks sitting in DC. This barely scratches the surface of what needs to be done, but it’d be a start.
I think about this a lot. When you have citizens who have been shaped to hate their fellow citizens where does the space exist for repair of society? Hard to see how this isn't the trajectory now. Economic collapse might be one way to hold things together, but there's a poison in the body politic.

Goldfinger is viewed by Bond fans as either the best "classic Bond", "one of the best Bond films ever", or both.

Besides being a flaming piece of shit, this shows JDV's ignorance, for his analogy fails utterly.  Sir Isaac Newton did serve in Parliament but avoided debate. He is famous for only speaking once:  during a heated dispute between members, he rose to quietly request that a drafty window be closed.
Also how Palestine has always been the victim and smol bean despite a decades long campaign of Egypt and Iran funded terror.

The mechanics for a PRIME game have never been more buttery smooth and I love the level design for the "dungeon" areas, but the desert is kinda a wash. Didn't mind the NPCs nearly as much as a lot of folks online, but Sylux is just one baffling choice after another.
Not just the ending, either. Never introducing your primary villain and locking basic explanation of their identity and motivation behind a 100% collection gate is just bad design.  And not the kind of thing you expect from even 2007-era Retro / Nintendo.

CW: Intox, ontologically manufactured consent, blood/biting, a touch of dysphoria  She seemed like just another MILF. Soft smile, soft tummy, soft heavy breast, the best among the rest. You don’t know *how* you missed her antlers with their three foot span.
She had an ethereal sound to her words as she urged you to talk on and on about the crushes in your heart and the silly-sweet fantasies in your head. You were so happy to be indulged that you didn’t even hear the fae-chimes and unearthly crackle in her voice.
So like an enraptured fool, you joined her when she invited you to leave with her. She even covered your tab! You were so elated that it didn’t even strike you as *that* strange when, instead of leading you out through the parking lot, she took you behind the bar and into the woods.
You were too caught up trying to complement how her tattered dress hung to her massive bosom in the moonlight to notice the threads of reality split and fray around you.
After a walk through the brush she sat you down on a moss-topped stump near a creek you’d never known before was there. You thought to ask, but she read the question on your face, and instead put into your mouth a blunt so thick and kushy that it must’ve been rolled by Dionysus himself.
The smoke and the drink left you awfully relaxed. Awfully open. Awfully careless.  “You’re silly to have followed me,” she said. The charm in her voice turned into a sinister chime.
You giggled and thought of a witty and flirty response. She spoke first.  “I’m going to change you. And by all the little gods… I hope you want that.”
It struck you then that she might be serious, and this might not be a cute little witchy hook-up. It might’ve been the inhuman huffing of her breath that gave it away–or maybe it was her teeth as they broke the skin of your neck in a succulent pinch.
You gasped. You wailed. She licked at the dribble of your red wet life and nuzzled you sweetly. You might have fled, but the weight of her thick furry arms pinned you down like the limbs of a fallen tree.  “Now, I know you,” she said. “Now I know what you are.”
She grabbed your chin and smiled a hungry smile.  “Now that I know what you are, I know what I want you to be!”
The creature crawled atop you. A sensuous weight pinned you to the broad, damp surface of the mossy tree trunk: two massive, supple thighs and the heavy buttocks that hung atop them. Claws like razors upon pawpads as soft as silk slit the shirt from your chest.
The bare, flat breast beneath threatened to shoot you through with a dysphoric pang; yet, she caught that curse in her long, wicked teeth like a runaway worm.
“That won’t do,” she said, and cupped her hands to your nipples. Before you could protest, she pinched, and tugged, and grabbed you with the whole of her paws–and pulled! She pulled, further than she should’ve possibly been able to, but your chest went with her.
Finally, she let go, and two massive breasts wobbled back so far and so fast that they knocked the glasses from your face!  ... *YOUR* breasts!
Through the haze in your head you started to giggle in joy, and so did she–but she didn’t stop. She raised her paws high above you, menacing like willow-branches, then brought them down against your hips with a firm *SMACK!*
It smarted, even as tipsy as you were! But, when you reached down to rub the spot where she struck, you found that your once-bony hips were as wide and plump as a Victorian pin-up model, and your triple-thick butt jiggled like a jello-mold against the stump as you explored yourself.
She shoved her impossibly-nimble paws beneath your fingers and rubbed the bruises with a proud “*humph~!*”  “Almost there,” she said. “Just this ol’ thing to adjust!”
You gasped when her padded claws snatched the base of your cock. The other paw reared up in the air, and for a moment, you felt a jolt of genuine terror.  Then she cackled. And all the creaking of the woods in the wind cackled with her, glimmers of moonlight dancing from her bouncing antlers.
“Gotcha,” she said, and–rather than smack you–she licked her bunny-whiskered lips and gobbled down the girth of your sex. Impossibly warm, furious and tender, like TV-static milk–then she pulled back with a hearty gasp for air.
When you looked down, you were no smaller than before–but somehow, you looked immensely more feminine. Your balls seemed to have vanished but your cock, its skin just as smooth and tender as your swollen breasts, still felt ready to pump a hot and virile load into the first thing it possibly could.
“What are you…” you cough, the weed still heavy in your throat and her furry hips heavy on your chest. “... what’re you doing to me?”  “What I want,” she said, her paws rubbing your cheeks like a mother might rub a stain from her little one’s brow. “Which is what you want!”
She giggled and withdrew her hands. You couldn’t see yourself, but you could feel the bulge of your neck recede in on itself and the weight of your cheeks grow rounder and softer.
“I made sure of it!” she added. You tried to ask her to explain that, but as you started to speak she shoved a paw into your lips–wet with your own thin, dribbly pre-cum.
Whatever *you* had become… the taste of yourself was the single most erotic thing you’d ever experienced. Yet, at least.  The thing you had become wanted to taste more.
With a strength you’d never known before you gripped the jackalope-beast about her rugged thighs and hoisted her up; then, you threw her down upon the stump, neatly switching places. The scent of her sex lured you in–a smell somewhere between firewood smoke and pure primal pheromonal power.
A petite cock, furred at its base, throbbing with the pounding of her hearts–*and* a lagomorphic slit, dripping fragrant lust.
A coin flipped somewhere in the basin of your psyche, and you went right to her musky bunnyshaft. You nuzzled, you worshipped, and you *inhaled.* Sharp, unwashed, full of virile force and dripping with eagerness.
It seemed so lovely and womanly on her burlesque frame, but your jaw had to stretch to accommodate the growing girth of her salmacian shaft.  It was worth it.
Whatever reservations you had about the night’s events dribbled out of your own fat she-creature cock just like the near-gallon of precum pooling at your feet.
The jackalope-demon stroked the now-voluminous hair that became your new mane, and told you that she was pleased with your enthusiasm. Proud to see her work in motion.
Her footpaws found their way beneath your swaying hips to the feminine length of your sex as it bobbed so lewdly beneath you. They began to stroke you, pawpads as firm as leather and as soft as silk against your impossibly sensitive member.
You moaned long and hard, but could only eek out a lewd grunt around the throbbing bunny meat in your throat.
The pleasure slammed through your head like a tsunami; it washed away reservations and doubts and shames and all manner of things that had no place in the mind or heart of a freshly-remade creature of the wild like yourself.  It didn’t take long for orgasm to follow.
You’d always cummed hard, but you never knew that you could cum so *intensely*--or for so *long*. Grunting, snorting, fighting to breathe as the lagomorphic cock in your throat filled your stomach with bitter-sticky-sweet seed.
Your mind felt like it melted out through your newly-remade ears, but sure enough, you woke a little while later.  Your knees stuck to the ground in a massive puddle of cum, almost all of it yours. You could tell by the scent–a scent you’d never known before but would forever recognize as your own.
Your new lover-sister-mother-remaker stroked your hair as you stirred.  “I’m proud of you,” she said, and ushered you into her arms upon the mossy bed of the stump.  “For what?” you ask. Her fur bristled against your own, prickly but comforting. Her warmth soaked into you and filled you with Being.
“For not falling apart. For taking this transformation so well. And most of all.”  She leans her head down and plants a kiss upon your own.  “For being hungry enough to follow me, and foolish enough not to run away.”

A couple years ago, I used some student loan money to buy some silver and gold at spot value, and I’ve been lucky on that risk.   Is the value of silver and gold skyrocketing, or is the dollar just losing considerable value?   Good for holders, but worried that inflation will spike again.

..., even though the entire prison population is around 8,200 and only seven inmates are undocumented and already serving sentences. These aren’t just innocuous lies in a vacuum. They are used to justify violence."

Basically all of politics is a series of performances and signifiers for you, isn’t it? Not a single thought about material reality has ever entered your head, god bless. I feel bad arguing with you because tbh you just seem too stupid to take seriously
Today we wear green to honour the six lives lost in the Québec City mosque attack and stand against Islamophobia and hate. The green square - symbolizing the mosque’s carpet - represents remembrance, solidarity, and our shared responsibility to build safer, inclusive communities.

I'm not sure people realise how bad the financial markets are atm, if you look at precious metal prices as a comparator:  Looking at late Sept. gbp per gram prices with peak-ish Jan.  Silver: 1 - 2.83 (183% increase) Gold: 90 - 129 (43% increase) Platinum: 35 - 68 (94% increase)
There is fairly big financial bubble... and something is going to break one way or another quite spectacularly if this carries on.

So many Catholics I know don’t like historical critical analysis because deep down they’re worried that it will prove their faith wrong.
This is a stark reminder of how quickly we’re moving in the wrong direction—428.6 ppm isn’t just a number, it reflects decades of delayed action. Data like this makes the urgency of real, systemic climate solutions impossible to ignore.
Some of you NFL lovers are going to have to include in your resistance to fascism, a total boycott of the NFL.   If they're allowing ICE into the Superbowl, it's a must.  Shouldn't be hard since it's off-season soon.  But, it's time for America to boycott big money sports as part of the resistance.

It's a direct violation of the 4th amendment, which is something ICE has been violating constantly and without repercussions. ALL of them must be taken to task for this violation by local law enforcement. ALL of them.

High streets are declining, with vital community amenities such as banks, pharmacies, and public toilets being replaced by bookmakers, takeaway outlets, and vape shops - the number of which has risen by 1200% in England in the past decade. This strain is particularly acute in the North.    2/3

Drawdowns don’t just cost you “-X%.”  They cost you years.  The deeper the drop, the longer the climb back,  and the odds of ever reclaiming your old high fall fast.  The biggest cost of a drawdown isn’t the loss. It’s the opportunity cost while you’re stuck recovering.

Today in America for conscious participants in life it’s difficult to not have an opinion about life in general. Some are swayed by sensitivities developed since childhood others struck by a single event choose a side. Viscerally most have the same response to cruelty. Since Jan 20, 2025 most folks
have felt off balance but have tried to wait and see. Drip, drip, drip, one by one cultural norms have been tossed aside. Programs have a binary feel as they go from 0 to 100 at the start. Most have been radically different than those before this administration. The advertised justification has been
the diagnosis that America is on the brink of collapse. The border connected to violent crime was thrust into the light. Crime statistics are interpreted relative to the bias of the interpreter like most statistics. Violence visited on anyone is unacceptable. When the solution has as much violence
as the problem it’s net no change. Except the solution reduces the sense of security for everyone when a masked armed force seems to randomly break car windows, chase people on Main Street, drag them out of court houses, and work up to killing them in the streets. Then we’re told this hurts me more
than it hurts you. The totality of federal government actions have taken more than they have given. We have become at affect of our government. The concern seems to constantly be on, ‘what’s next?’ Which is not a problem created by the governed. The knee-jerk reaction to everything produces the
sense that we are all on a roller coaster. There’s one elected position in the country that can control the general sense of well being by what they do and don’t do. We are managed by an individual accustomed to tugging the reins as they saw fit in their one person led organization. As you all have
experienced from scale doesn’t work without injecting lurches from one uncomfortable position to another. At 80 a human is not going to change much from learned behavior. Which in this case has not produced a positive result in any chosen endeavor. The refusal to truly consider all sides of the
issues has given us one man rule from an individual incapable of managing an enterprise the size of the federal government. Whether you choose to believe this or not. The track record speaks for itself.
This lifted the roof on our farmhouse about an inch and let it back down. Hell of a storm and a huge mess.

Ehm... Swedish native speaker here. I have NEVER heard of this proverb, and it does not "feel" like a genuine phrase to me. It is grammatically correct and the spelling is fine too, but it literary translates to "worry gives small things a big shadow" (things in plural and shadow in singular)
Tried to google it and get very few hits, all of them from English sources claiming this to be a Swedish proverb, and a few from languages I cant understand. No Swedish sources at all. Nothing wrong with the proverb, but it doesnt seem to have a Swedish origin

IANAL, so I dunno, but as a matter of justice, I think that detaining witnesses to your criminal project should be actionable.  Not just as a personal matter to those detained, but to prevent ICE/CBP from detaining anyone they want just b/c they feel like doling out punishment.

Fact: We get to places like this due to a series of concessions over one/two to four to six years, and @democrats.senate.gov dominated by ppl who call themselves "moderate" but are either corrupt, bought, too comfortable in their seats, spineless or AOTA. They are nominally pro choice Republicans.
We need a concerted national effort to flip the Senate both TO Democrat/Democratic Socialist, but also to FLIP the people who are constantly driving us further into fascism with their "compromises."   Its all theater: The GOP knows Schumer will flip. That theater, however, harms real people.
You have to have a solid moral compass and a spine to get through this without further harming people and our senators do not. No matter how many nice videos they make or speeches they give. They already know most voters don't pay attention or know enough to understand the hornswoggling.
We truly need to elect better Democrats or there will be nothing left.

Because, the progressives don't bother voting when their agenda is ignored; young voters are apathetic when there is no effective choice; and the dems looks weak.  crush ice

I think conserning ourselves with marksmanship or use of artillery glosses over the fact that the Confederate army had to buy most of their weapons from outside of the continent, due to their lack of industrial capacity.  From the very countries Armchair Warlord think they would "roll".
Weapon use and doctrine are all well and good, but you have to look at industrial output and field experience.  All other being equal (let's say they fight on an island equidistant to their home country), Confederates are green while European armies have all fought actual battles in 1860.

Homan is “better” than Bovino because Homan is less charismatic and physically able and has less leadership aura and is more mockable in general. Nobody thought “he is a better person who will make better decisions”  It’s vibe based and it’s still probably an accurate assessment.

Queensland QCAT Act review. Pleased to have lodged a submission on the Queensland QCAT Act Statutory review 2025-26 dealing with Health Practitioner Disciplinary Jurisdiction in Queensland. Thank you to practitioner and patient collaborators. tinyurl.com/5atevw48
The QCAT submission focused on Issues Paper 6. It highlighted #paramedicine as a low-volume but high-complexity caseload, with few cases nationally resulting in deregistration or prohibition. Reform efforts should focus on #assessor capacity, #procedural #fairness, & early #resolution.
The QCAT submission noted #paramedicine was a #health profession requiring proportionate, expert, & contextual disciplinary processes.  With targeted enhancements, QCAT was supported as the appropriate forum. Last days to submit anything as the consultation closes 31 Jan. tinyurl.com/yktytrax

🧵1/3  Okay!  Mitali's Dad was actually a chef and owned his own little restaurant. Until I manage to actually worldbuild the food/meals, it's just going to be Indian food. It will still be inspired by that later.  Anyway, Mitali loves spicy food. Not just hot food, but food that has lots of spices.
🧵2/3  For now, his favorite foods are lemon fried rice and dahl (a lentil dish). Mostly he just loves it because it reminds him of his Dad.   Sam's pretty boring as of right now, though I might change that later. She mostly eats whatever Tara cooks and is fine with it. She likes Tara's spaghetti.
🧵3/3  Her favorite food is probably berries or fruit of some kind, just by itself.  Bonus points? Here's Mitali reacting to an attempt to react his Dad's cooking gone wrong. He rarely gets angry with other people, but here's one instance where he snaps.  #Writing #WritingCommunity #Writesky

If every immigrant in the US were arrested today, it wouldn’t justify the funding ICE receives. The goal was never immigration, it was to establish a private army for Trump to keep power. The sooner we defund the force, the safer we will be.

Dems continue to shoot themselves in the foot by trying to control a symptom (gun violence) instead of pushing for the cure (healthcare, financial aid, mental health access and care, community enrichment).
And while you might not feel like this is an important issue, it is to millions of people, including LGBTQ, female, and minority gun owners. It’s a massively big idea deal to them. They’re in a situation where no one is FOR them.  Be peaceful, but not harmless.

And he also loves rocks, he's got a cool collection :)

Well it's worth being careful using the term 'flopped' as a player can be good elsewhere with the right manager, system, or just new location.  Some are journeymen but others it can restart a faltering career, Rashford to Villa last year, or Garner at Everton, hopefully Adama at West Ham
Why is it ok with tRump supporters to rape kill and steal and lie just to be white. There's a smarter way. And it's easy. Love you neighbors. We can care and love for free. No one gets hurt or be an asshole and be ok with raping kids and killing kids to be white in America. Not a smart.
Yes! That totally came across. In fact, I almost replied: True art makes you wonder what you’re seeing! I scaled that back upon reflection — beware absolutes! —but I do especially appreciate images that invite multiple perspectives or interpretations.

For me it's absolutely "isn't soy responsible for destroying the Amazon?"   Because (in case you aren't aware) the answer is yes! Soy is destroying the Amazon. But that soy, like 75% of the world's crop, is grown for cattle feed. Animal agriculture is at root of rainforest destruction, not tofu.

Maybe this is a regional thing, but I connect the idea of the “American Dream” with immigrants as much as white people.  (And my guess for why they went with that branding is they were founded in 2024, at the height of the Nationalism revival trend)

For starters, it was the administration that self-limited themselves on how much they were willing to spend.   Didn't come from Congress. That was a political decision for the White House.   And when they did spend that money only a third of it was stimulus.   2/3 were tax cuts and state support

Denmark is in the EU single market.  That means Denmark can hire anyone from any country in the single labor market.  Denmark has foreigners working Denmark jobs, those forigen workers get Denmark benefits, and they don't need immigration.  Its an example you would not want to follow.
This is much more similar to the farming market in the US in the past, in particular pre 9/11 immigration crackdowns, where migrants would come, work farms, and leave. Anti-immigration resulted in more migrants overstaying in the US out of fear of not being let back in next season.

Kristi Noem was always just the face of ICE. It will always be Stephen Miller behind any and all racist actions. Firing Noem won't change anything. Miller needs to be in jail.

Apologies, but I think I would have to look back at the paper I wrote for his class to remember if there was more specific things to dive into that he brought up in that book. It’s been a while since I’ve read it.

The Dems (and Republican who care about DHS abuses) should demand as pat of the budget that DHS share with local authorities all the evidence it has about DHS officer shootings so they can investigate too.  1/2

This is tangential, but:  Anybody who says producers and QA aren't "real" gamedevs needs to take a long, hard look at themselves and ask where they'd be without support structures built into the fabric of their work life

I know they do this for every Nioh game, but I hate timed demos, thankfully it's more than a weekend here and there like Nioh 1/2, but still what's the point other for them to collect data, seems like a waste of time for the devs and players  It should be up until the game launches at least

"personally committed to me" and "hopeful his promise" are the words that should tell anyone paying attention that nothing will come of this.  You know what Republicans would do if someone made them a promise? They'd hold his feet to the fire. If only Democrats had that kind of willpower.

Yes, such good fun to be a bitter divorced middle-aged dude who misdirects his anger—IRL and in the voting booth—on society and just about everyone.
Thinking about it, the Buraikan drama CD really adds a lot of context & implications on the events that occurred in ParaLive (esp S1). Haruomi self-isolated & stopped making music after his dad's passing for 2 years until Chisei stepped in & inspired him to try again+
Then Chisei died which led Haruomi to quit music again. While he no longer isolated himself as much as back then (since he's actively managing Raimentei after that), he still decided to let the legend fade...until ParaLive. Since the event is public, that meant he must've known+
that someone's using Buraikan's name to lure phantom rappers. This combined w/ other undisclosed reasons might've made Haruomi decide to investigate the matter further. And along the way...maybe witnessing the cast giving it their all inspired him. I mean, if+
he didn't feel anything he would've just  resumed to managing Raimentei w/o thinking about music again. I doubt he would even do that match against czmz if he didn't give a damn. But maybe their passion had put back that spark & combined w/ the knowledge of phantoms had driven+
Haruomi to bring the legend to life for just a little longer. On another note, maybe it's just my czmz rot but there are so many parallels btwn Haruomi & Kanata. If Nayuta were dead for real, Kanata might've done what Haruomi did & isolated himself. It couldn't be a coincedence+
that Haruomi was grieving for 2 years-the same number of years Kanata was in a state of denial. Both of them even have loved ones who decided to disappear quietly because they didn't want to burden them 😭. My headcanon is that as a father figure, maybe Haruomi sees himself in+
Kanata and was happy that he didn't wound up the same way as he did. He wanted him to be happy with his brother, and not end up like him; lonely & clinging to a ghost.
I would like one Blue-anon type to explain to me why Harris has never once acted like the election was stolen in anyway.
