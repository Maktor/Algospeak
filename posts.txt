Something odd just happened - Go Away is now Strawberry Switchblade's second most streamed track on Spotify, overtaking Since Yesterday. 🧵

Go Away picked up popularity last year and isn't stopping. Not entirely sure what's driving it, but it's gratifying to see such a representative track getting the love. An early version of Go Away appears on the same 1982 demo EP as Trees and Flowers. www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6de...
Go Away was re-recorded in 1983 as the B-side of their debut single, a lusciously arranged new recording of Trees and Flowers. That version is sparse and icy, just voices and guitar to convey the song's power. www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwEb...
In 1984, Go Away was re-re-recorded for the band's album. This has a heavier mood, an ominous piano motif leading the way while the richer production brilliantly brings the cold peculiarity into relief. It's this version that's getting all the new attention. www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCat...

Although Digimon Adventure started it all, I believe it was Digimon Tamers that definitively defined the future of Digimon anime.  Something like that needed an opening theme to match, and boy did we get it.
It's fascinating to look back and see how Kōji Wada, since his debut, only released one banger after another. He was a very talented artist, but above all, he was a singer born for anime music.
But the aesthetics and editing style of this OP are also worth mentioning: I love the hand-drawn backgrounds and the transitions where Impmon and Beelzemon are faintly visible, as well as the sequence with the silhouettes of the main characters while all the digivolutions appear in the background.
Of course, I'm once again showing off my country's version. Notice the singer's energy.
Despite the pacing issues in its final stretch, Digimon Tamers was an almost perfect anime.  BIG AND BIGGER BIGGEST DREAMER

Yeah, it’s bizarre - I love Sinners, but really only the first half, and then the silver thread that is Jack O’Connell in the second half.   The second half is a mess when the movie turns into a not-particularly great horror movie, but then picks up back again at the end.

Feels like only yesterday that republicans were outraged by the mere idea of child trafficking.
The Republicans practiced their strategy. The strategy is to keep talking BS. And hardly ever ask questions. When they do ask a question, they interrupt Jack Smith the second he starts answering. And then complain he didn't answer the question.
We should make a tier list of all the big furry man ocs from social media. If I make a google form will you all help me

Yeah, I get that, I just wonder if it’s missing an angle for a (presumably) primarily queer audience specifically. There are thousands of “how to write” and “how to build a brand” posts out there, so what sets yours apart?
For example, aside from the idea of a network of queer authors, one thing that really resonated in the first one was the idea of safety. What to watch out for, how to protect yourself, etc. That’s something most authors don’t have to consider, but your audience absolutely does.
I dunno, I’ve never done anything like this, so I’m just spitballing as a reader. Take it for what you will. 🤷‍♀️

Agreed.  Unfortunately, Hanger is not immune to what most of us (men) do, and that's keep our family and longtime friends close...no matter what they do. It was a DUMB move to take a pic and it shows a lack of awareness but it also pisses me off that it was posted in an attempt to gain clout.
